# scratchPage

## The name explains it all.
**scratch** as in scratchbook for quick notes and **page**... Well, Ithink that's pretty self explanatory.

### Why?
The idea came forth when I was doing some javaScript tutorials, and just flat-out refused to use web-embedded editor on the site. I'm somewhat old school, so I just prefer to have the environment local on my hard drive, and once you go Vim, you never come back.
And at the same time, I was also getting very frustrated with jostling different script files, editing the HTML pages I was using, and how ofter I accidentally overwrote something I really didn't want to.
So, I made this. Sure, it's very amateurish, but I learned more about javaScript in one night with this, than on the whole week of tutorials I was doing beforehand. Gotta start somewhere, right?
