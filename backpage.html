  <h3>What is it?</h3>
 
  <p>A very very simple website which allows you to use jQuery to load you locally stored .js scripts to experiment with. Also, my case study to learn new technologies. This as much as a study journal as it’s a “real” project.</p>

  <h4><em>The name says it pretty well:</em></h4>

  <p><strong>scratch</strong> as in scratchbook for quick notes and <strong>Page</strong> because it is a page. Duh.</p>

  <h3>Why?</h3>

  <p>The idea came forth when I was doing some JavaScript tutorials, and just flat-out hated the web based editors after 2 years on Vim. Also, I like to have my files stored locally for future reference &amp; recycling code.</p>
  <p>So, I made this. Sure, it’s very amateurish (and done a million times before), but I learned more about JavaScript &amp; jQuery in one night with this, than on a whole week of tutorials I was doing before. Gotta start somewhere, right?</p>

  <h3>Database</h3>
  <p>Thinking of learning either SQLite or mongoDB for this (which is the main reason behind the whole database. SQLite would be a good stepping point for RDBMS based databases, but mongoDB seems like a great fit for learning more about node.js &amp; different ways to use JSON.</p>

  <h3>CSS</h3>
  <p>Not my favourite subject, but I’m really far behind on anything to do with HTML or FrontEnd in general.<br>
    Would be a good chance to experiment &amp; develop a style for myself to use in the future, as there’s not too much going on in the front.</p>

  <h3>Django?</h3>
  <p>I’m way more proficient with Python than I’m with JS, and it would be nice to finally take a dive to Django.<br>
  Also, it seems like a good fit for either mySQL or PostgreSQL. Then again, the whole project started off as a JavaScript exercise. Maybe make a brach or something later on.</p>
